# Spotify code to STL

This project aims to create a Python module to generate a spotify code in 3D from the spotify api and numpy-stl.

It can then be used for different purpose such as :
* An automated, on demand 3D printed spotify tag (on a small scale assembly line per example)
* A simple UI to generate a 3D model of a song

# Quick start

[comment]: <> (TODO : Once the module is published, `pip install stlotipy`, `import stlotipy`)
Since the module is not public yet :

1. Add the `spotify-code-to-stl` folder in your project
2. `import spotify-code-to-stl`

Then you can start using the module with the available functions.
